1) The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro services on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and now they want to set up some namespaces deployments etc. Based on the current requirements, the team has shared some details as below:


  Create a namespace named dev and deploy a POD within it. Name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use the nginx image with the latest tag. Ensure to specify the tag as nginx:latest.
  Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

* Create the Namespace:
  kubectl create -n dev
* Deploy the Pod: You can create the pod directly with kubectl run or by using a YAML configuration file. Hereâ€™s how to do it with both methods:

  Method 1: Directly with kubectl run
  kubectl run dev-nginx-pod --image=nginx:latest -n dev

  Method 2: Using a YAML File Create a YAML file, dev-nginx-pod.yaml, with the following content:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dev-nginx-pod
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest


* kubectl apply -f dev-nginx-pod.yaml
* kubectl get namespaces
* kubectl get pods -n dev
